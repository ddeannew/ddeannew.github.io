title: "Escape Rooms"

<p>
When I was teaching in classrooms, I found that students enjoyed learning while playing. I attempted to gamify the experience by creating these sets of escape rooms.

<p>
I have used these escape rooms in both the classroom and camp setting. Have fun and enjoy the storyline! You can copy the escape room yourself and edit it with your own content.
