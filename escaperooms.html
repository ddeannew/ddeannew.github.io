title: "Escape Rooms"

<p>
When I was teaching in classrooms, I found that students enjoyed learning while playing. I attempted to gamify the experience by creating these sets of escape rooms.
</p>
<p>
I have used these escape rooms in both the classroom and camp setting. Have fun and enjoy the storyline! You can copy the escape room yourself and edit it with your own content.

<h2>Instructions</h2>
Welcome to the Grand Expo 2020. You are entering the booth that is displaying the worldâ€™s very first time machine. You will be meeting the inventor shortly. In this escape room, you will be faced with different puzzles and you will need to solve them in order to escape. Feel free to click anywhere on the page. It should lead you to a different point in the time machine mystery. Please turn on your audio, as this will be an interactive experience. If you come across an error, feel free to email me. Otherwise, you can try refreshing the screen. Happy escaping!
